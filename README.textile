h1. Simple oembed implementation for Java based on Apache HttpClient

This is a very simple Java client for consuming "Oembed":http://www.oembed.com/ enabled sites.

It uses "Jackson":http://jackson.codehaus.org/ for JSON processing and JAXB for XML parsing.

The project is a ready to use configured maven/eclipse project. 

java-oembed supports caching through "xmemcached":http://code.google.com/p/xmemcached/ if a memcached instance is available.
